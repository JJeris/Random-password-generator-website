# Random-password-generator-website
A website that generates random combinations of letters, symbols and numbers, that can be used as passwords for people, who canâ€™t be bothered to create them themselves.

*This is a 1.0 version, that is only made through the most basic means (html, css, js), as in, no frameworks or Bootstrap were used. Later editions will use a MVC, such as the Laravel Frameworks
